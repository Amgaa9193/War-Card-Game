# WAR
# Introduction 
  Welcome to my solution to the Aspen Capital's take home challenge.

# Technologies Used
  - Flask web framework
  - Python3 
  - Sqlite database([_SQLAlchemy ORM_](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/))
  

# Getting Started

1. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the following code to start the server:

        python3 main.py

3. Run the app:

        python3 project.py

# Usage

1. Open localhost:5000
2. Press the start button to start a game between two simulated players
3. Press the Veiw Score Button to see lifetime wins for each player stored in a database.

# Room for improvement:
1. A Docker image
2. Make it more fun: Make it for two human players so the person who loses does a dare picked by the computer randomly. 
3. Better UI for example Use Python turtle pre-installed library to create the card pictures.
